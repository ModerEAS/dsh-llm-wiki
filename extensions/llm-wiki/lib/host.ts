 * Host adapter for the coding agents that can load this extension:
 *
 *  - **pi**   — `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, config dir `.pi`
 *  - **omp**  — oh-my-pi (`@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`), config dir `.omp`
 *  - **dsh**  — DeepSeek Harness native plugin (`src/dsh/`), config dir `.dsh`
 *
 * omp rewrites `@earendil-works/pi-*` (and bare `typebox`) imports onto its own
 * bundled packages at load time (its `legacy-pi-compat.ts`), so the *module
 * graph* needs no changes. What does differ is the on-disk config layout:
 *
 * | | pi | omp |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | user dir      | `~/.pi/agent`   | `~/.omp/agent` |
 * | project dir   | `<cwd>/.pi`     | `<cwd>/.omp`   |
 * | settings file | `settings.json` | `settings.json`, then `config.yml` |
 *
 * omp explicitly does **not** read `.pi` (its config source order is
 * `.omp` → `.claude` → `.codex` → `.gemini`), so a wiki configured under pi
 * would silently lose its settings after switching hosts. This module keeps
 * both layouts readable and picks a sensible file to write to.
 *
 * Everything here is additive: on pi with only a `.pi/` directory the effective
 * behaviour is identical to the pre-compat code path, which keeps upstream
 * merges clean.
